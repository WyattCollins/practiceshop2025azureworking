        <h2>Our Backstory</h2>
        <p>The Coffee Shop began in 2015 when two friends, driven by their love for coffee, decided to turn their dream into reality. For them, coffee was more than just a morning or afternoon pick-me-up—it was a daily ritual and a part of everyday life. What started as a cozy shop in North Lakeland has since grown into three locations, with the goal of expanding across Florida to share their passion for great coffee with even more people.</p>
